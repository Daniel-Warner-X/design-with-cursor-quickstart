# Cursor for UX Designers

This project provides a quickstart guide for **UX Designers** looking to integrate Cursor into their workflow. 

## 1\. Jumpstart Your Project

Application builders such as **Google Gemini Canvas** offer an intuitive chat interface for working through the first few iterations of an idea. This is the fastest way to get started simulating user experiences. There are differing points of view on which prompting techniques yield the best resultsâ€”the best way to find out what works for you and your project is to dive in and start prompting.
