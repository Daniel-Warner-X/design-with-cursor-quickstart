## Jumpstart Your Project with a Natural Language Application Builder (like Google Gemini Canvas)

1. **[Go to Google Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/app)** and describe what you want to build. Gemini will automatically switch to Canvas mode when you ask for UI/design elements. This is a good thing. This is where you will create design artifacts.
   - Ask it for something you actually want (avoid hypothetical design challenges)
   - Keep your requests simple and high-level initially
   - Use positive language ( "don't" or "avoid" tend to cause confusion )


3. **Iterate with Google Gemini Canvas** until you hit the point of diminishing returns.
   - **Gemini is great at zero-shot/one-shot prompting**, brainstorming, and laying in the broad strokes of a solution. 
   - **Know when to stop.** If Gemini starts making unwanted changes, or you start to require fine-grained changes, or if you want to share your project it's time to bring your project into your local environment and use Cursor.
   - **Ask Gemini how to run your project locally.** Before leaving Gemini request setup instructions for running your project locally and save them in the README file of your local project.
