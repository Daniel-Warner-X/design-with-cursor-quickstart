Use this file to document product requirements, relevant user personas, UX Guidelines etc. Cursor will use it as context.

For example, I might include the orginal prompt I used with Gemini that gave me a great result:

Create a card for a patternfly-based dashboard that tracks the number of agents I have running in a given OpenShift environment. This for a security dashboard so I need to know which of those agents have write permissions on any resource within that environment. It is also important to flag any agents that may have write permissions via another agent they interact with.Â 

Delete this file from the .cursorignore file if want to use it.
